# Ocean Waves #
> Small module for creating realistic ocean waves.

This module just creates realistic time series ocean waves.

There is a lot missing here, but is useful.

## Wave Spectrums ##

Ocean waves are made up of combinations of a sprectrum of complex
exponentials derived from a variety of sources. The wave spectrum
represents the ideal frequency domain of a given sea state. If a
random phase is given to each component of the spectrum, the combined
components create stochastic waves in the time domain.

Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum models fully developed seas at different
theoretical sea states based on the wind speed above the water.
